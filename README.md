# Repeatabilty of Multiparametric Prostate MRI Radiomics Features

This repository contains data and code accompanying our publication(s) on "Repeatabilty of Multiparametric Prostate MRI Radiomics Features"

[TBA links to paper(s)]

## Data

### Exctracted Features

The [TBA] folder contains all extracted features we used in the study.


## Jupyter Notebooks

The jupyter notebooks require Python >= 3.6. The jupyter notebooks also require two custom Python libraries wich you should download and put in a location where it will be found by Python (e.g. point the PYTHONPATH environment variable to the parent folder).

### Feature extraction

The [TBA notebook name] contains the code that performed the feature extraction. You will also need the image data and the pyradiomics library [TBA link]. Check the paper for information on how to get the image data. Note that it is not guaranteed that a different versino of pyradiomics will create the same results for all features. Check the paper as well as the extracted features tables for the version that was used for this study.

### Figure generation

The [TBA notebook name] contains the code that was used to generate the figures for the pre-print paper [TBA link]. It also contains additional figures and can be used as a good basis to create your own additional figures from the data.
